        <p>PLEASE NOTE: This site is for fun so it is going to be trash. We honestly dont care so dont @ us</p>
        <p>Welp this site has come a long way since a blank page lol. I thought its time i updated the little about page here. We are a bunch of devs that are bored in qurantine so decided to make a website together to pass the time. and its lowkey fire in my opinion. Each dev has their own page located in the menu just below, some are password protected, but if you're good enough with code, you should be able to breeze right through. If you are interested in being a dev with us please DM me on discord at SlavicJedi#4047. </p>
        <p>Co dev is KaliBoi#1483</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you know me in real life please just ignore all of this and pretend you never came here lol</p>
